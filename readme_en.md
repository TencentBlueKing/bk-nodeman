To establish a connection with BlueKing's service system, users' business hosts must first ensure that each business host installs the Agent program. BlueKing has launched NodeMan SaaS to solve the problem of quick installation of Agent in various network environments.

NodeMan is an application that helps operation and maintenance personnel to realize Agent installation, plug-in management and other back-end service management.

It is the same principle as manual Agent installation, but NodeMan eliminates the need for manual typing and tedious execution of script installation commands. Users can perform Agent installation and plug-in management intuitively and easily through a visual window without logging into the server. It supports Agent installation in various environments, concurrent host operation, CMDB import and batch import, and plugin management such as start, stop, restart, reload, and whether to host or not, which is efficient and convenient.
